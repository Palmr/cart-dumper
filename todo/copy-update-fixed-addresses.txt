Below are the opcodes which if copied to ram should have their params (nn) added to the dest-source memory location.
To do there needs to be a lookup table (or two with the 0xCB codes...) for all opcodes with param lengths so that the copy routine can only test opcode bytes against the table below.

Instr Params  Opcode 
JP		nn			C3
JP 		NZ, nn	C2
JP 		Z, nn 	CA
JP 		NC, nn 	D2
JP 		C, nn 	DA
CALL	nn 			CD
CALL 	NZ, nn 	C4
CALL 	Z, nn 	CC
CALL 	NC, nn	D4
CALL 	C, nn 	DC

Code would be something like:
  copyOffset16 = dest16 - source16
  if currentByte8 = updatableOpcode8:
    nextByte8 = nextByte8 ADC copyOffset16(lower-byte)
    nextByte8 = nextByte8 ADC copyOffset16(upper-byte)
